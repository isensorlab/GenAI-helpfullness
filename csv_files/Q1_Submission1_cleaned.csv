user_1009,146,"You said:\r\nI’m planning a spring break trip and want to explore popular destinations. Could you list the top five spring break destinations known for a mix of fun nightlife, interesting cultural experiences, and reasonable costs for students? Please provide a brief explanation of why each place is worth visiting.\r\n\r\nReasoned for a few seconds\r\nWondering about spring break spots\r\n\r\nI’m mapping out the top five spring break destinations that have a blend of lively nightlife, enriching cultural experiences, and budget-friendly options specifically for students.\r\n\r\nHere are five popular spring break destinations known for a good balance of lively nightlife, cultural highlights, and relatively affordable costs for students:\r\n\r\nCancún, Mexico\r\n\r\nWhy Visit: Cancún is a classic spring break hotspot, offering a vibrant party scene with clubs on the famous Hotel Zone strip. Beyond nightlife, you’ll find nearby Mayan ruins (like Chichén Itzá and Tulum) and beautiful cenotes to explore, adding a cultural and natural dimension to your trip. Flights and all-inclusive packages can often be found at student-friendly prices.\r\nPunta Cana, Dominican Republic\r\n\r\nWhy Visit: Known for its pristine beaches and turquoise waters, Punta Cana has a bustling resort scene with plenty of nightlife. Look beyond the resorts to experience local culture in the nearby towns, where you can enjoy authentic Dominican cuisine and music. Many hotels offer all-inclusive deals, which help keep daily costs predictable.\r\nPuerto Rico (San Juan)\r\n\r\nWhy Visit: As a U.S. territory, Puerto Rico is relatively easy (and often cheaper) to reach from many U.S. cities—no passport required for U.S. citizens. San Juan combines modern nightlife with historic charm in Old San Juan’s colonial streets, colorful buildings, and 16th-century forts. Outside the city, you can take day trips to the El Yunque rainforest or the bioluminescent bays.\r\nNew Orleans, Louisiana (USA)\r\n\r\nWhy Visit: New Orleans is famous for its music, nightlife, and colorful local culture. Though Mardi Gras is the city’s peak party season, spring break still brings plenty of live jazz, blues, and food festivals. Wander the French Quarter, savor Creole and Cajun dishes, and explore the city’s unique history. Accommodation and dining can be found at a range of price points.\r\nPlaya del Carmen, Mexico\r\n\r\nWhy Visit: Playa del Carmen offers a slightly more laid-back vibe than Cancún but still features a fun nightlife scene, especially along the vibrant Fifth Avenue (Quinta Avenida). You’ll find plenty of opportunities for cultural day trips to Mayan ruins (Tulum, Cobá), snorkeling in coral reefs, or swimming in cenotes. Hostel and budget hotel options make it an attractive destination for cost-conscious travelers.\r\nEach of these places provides a mix of festive nightlife, interesting local or regional culture, and reasonable lodging and dining options, making them great choices for spring breakers looking to balance fun and affordability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou said:\r\nFor each of the five destinations you’ve recommended, please create a detailed daily itinerary for a 5-day trip. Include estimated budgets for each day, the best local attractions, any must-try foods, and any off-the-beaten-path experiences.\r\n\r\nReasoned for 10 seconds\r\nEngaging with itinerary ideas\r\n\r\nListing down 5-day itineraries for five destinations, focusing on daily plans, budgets, attractions, foods, and unique experiences. Progressing through daily highlights.\r\n\r\nMapping daily budgets\r\n\r\nI'm piecing together a daily budget estimate of $50-$100 per day, including lodging, food, and activities, while keeping in mind potential variations.\r\n\r\nEngaging in Cancun\r\n\r\nI’m planning a 5-day itinerary for Cancun, highlighting activities, local attractions, and must-try foods. This approach ensures a comprehensive and engaging travel experience.\r\n\r\nBalancing details and conciseness\r\n\r\nI’m crafting a 5-day itinerary for Punta Cana, aiming for an overall budget of $75-$150, focusing on activities and local attractions while keeping the overview concise.\r\n\r\nCreating planned itineraries\r\n\r\nI'm honing Day 1 in Cancun, balancing beach fun with nightlife, while aligning with a student-friendly budget of $75-$150. Progressing through daily attractions to ensure a balanced travel plan.\r\n\r\nCrafting detailed travel plans\r\n\r\nI’m mapping out itineraries for Puerto Rico, New Orleans, and Playa del Carmen, incorporating local attractions, must-try foods, and daily costs, to ensure a comprehensive and engaging travel guide.\r\n\r\nBelow you’ll find a suggested 5-day itinerary for each of the five spring break destinations—Cancún, Punta Cana, San Juan (Puerto Rico), New Orleans, and Playa del Carmen. Each itinerary balances fun, culture, and budget-conscious travel. Daily cost estimates are approximate and can vary depending on your personal spending habits and time of year.\r\n\r\n1.

This list covers clothing, accessories, electronics, travel documents, and other essentials to handle local weather and activities.\r\n\r\n1. Travel Documents & Essentials\r\nPassport/ID:\r\nInternational trips (e.g., Mexico, Dominican Republic) require a valid passport.\r\nFor Puerto Rico, if you’re a U.S. citizen, bring a valid government-issued ID instead of a passport.\r\nFor domestic U.S. travel (like New Orleans), a driver’s license or state ID will suffice.\r\nBoarding Passes & Itinerary: Keep them printed or accessible on your phone.\r\nTravel Insurance Documents: If you’ve purchased insurance, bring digital/physical copies.\r\nEmergency Contacts & Copies of Documents: Store copies of your ID/passport in a safe place or email them to yourself.\r\n2.

Toiletries & Health Items\r\nBasic Toiletries: Toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, body wash, deodorant.\r\nPersonal Medications: In original bottles with prescriptions if necessary.\r\nFirst-Aid Kit: Band-aids, pain relievers, motion sickness tablets, anti-diarrheal, aloe vera gel for sunburn.\r\nHand Sanitizer & Wipes: Good for quick clean-ups, especially if you’ll be on the go.\r\n7.

Tips for Handling Local Weather\r\nStay Hydrated: Hot and humid destinations can dehydrate you fast.\r\nPlan for Rain: Tropical regions often have sudden showers—pack a compact rain jacket or umbrella.\r\nProtect Against Heat & Sun: Sunscreen, hats, sunglasses, and taking breaks in the shade are essential.\r\nLayer Up in Variable Climates: New Orleans can have cooler evenings and random showers, so layers are your friend.\r\nFinal Checklist Highlights\r\nValid Passport/ID, Copies of Important Documents\r\nCash & Cards (plus a backup in case of loss or emergency)\r\nLightweight, Breathable Clothes & Swimwear\r\nComfortable Shoes (Walking + Water-Friendly)\r\nSunscreen & Insect Repellent\r\nPortable Phone Charger/Power Bank\r\nHat & Sunglasses\r\nReusable Water Bottle\r\nSmall First-Aid Kit\r\nRain Gear (Umbrella/Poncho/Jacket)\r\nWith these essentials, you’ll be well-prepared for beaches, nightlife, historical tours, and any outdoor adventures that these destinations have to offer. Safe travels!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou said:\r\nWhat are some effective strategies or websites for finding discounted flights and affordable accommodations, such as hostels or budget-friendly hotels, in these destinations? Could you also suggest how far in advance we should book?\r\nReasoned for a couple of seconds\r\nHere are some tried-and-true strategies and resources for finding discounted flights and budget-friendly accommodations, along with general guidelines on how far in advance you should book.\r\n\r\n1. Discounted Flights\r\nFlight Search Websites & Tools\r\nAggregators\r\n\r\nSkyscanner: Popular for its “cheapest month” feature and flexible date searches.\r\nMomondo: Similar to Skyscanner, offers a wide range of airlines and alternative routes.\r\nGoogle Flights: Great for price tracking and calendar-based fare insights.\r\nKayak: Offers price alerts and a flexible date calendar.\r\nStudent-Focused\r\n\r\nStudentUniverse: Specifically caters to students and young travelers with negotiated airline deals.\r\nSTA Travel: Although their retail presence has changed, keep an eye on any student or youth travel consolidators for special pricing.\r\nDeal-Specific Sites & Newsletters\r\n\r\nScott’s Cheap Flights (now “Going”): Sends alerts for flash sales and mistake fares.\r\nSecret Flying or TravelPirates: Blogs and newsletters focusing on discounted, off-peak, or error fares.\r\nFlight Booking Tips\r\nFlexibility in Dates & Airports\r\n\r\nIf your spring break dates are a bit flexible, use the “flexible date” or “cheapest month” tools to spot significant savings.\r\nCheck alternative airports (e.g., flying into Cozumel vs. Cancún, or considering Fort Lauderdale vs. Miami for a U.S. layover).\r\nSet Price Alerts\r\n\r\nMost flight aggregators let you set alerts for your preferred routes, notifying you of price drops.\r\nOff-Peak Travel\r\n\r\nMidweek flights (Tuesdays or Wednesdays) are often cheaper than weekend departures.\r\nBooking Windows\r\n\r\nDomestic Flights (e.g., to New Orleans): Aim to book 1–3 months in advance.\r\nInternational Flights (e.g., Mexico, Dominican Republic): Typically 2–4 months in advance for the best balance between availability and early-bird pricing.\r\nFor busy spring break travel, consider the higher end of these ranges (or even slightly earlier if your dates are set).\r\n2. Affordable Accommodations\r\nBooking Sites for Hostels & Budget Hotels\r\nHostelworld\r\n\r\nSpecializes in hostels worldwide, showing reviews, ratings, and detailed amenities.\r\nBooking.com\r\n\r\nOffers filters for budget hotels and hostels, often with free cancellation.\r\nLook out for “Genius” discounts if you use Booking.com frequently.\r\nAgoda\r\n\r\nStrong presence in Asia but also has deals worldwide, sometimes listing prices in different currencies for better savings.\r\nAirbnb\r\n\r\nPrivate rooms or entire apartments can be surprisingly affordable when split among a group.\r\nCheck cleaning/service fees, which can sometimes turn a cheap per-night rate into a bigger expense.\r\nHotelsCombined or Trivago\r\n\r\nCompare multiple hotel booking sites at once, helping you spot different rates for the same property.\r\nAccommodation Booking Tips\r\nRead Reviews Thoroughly\r\n\r\nEspecially for hostels, focus on location, cleanliness, and security.\r\nBook Directly\r\n\r\nSometimes contacting the hostel/hotel directly can yield special discounts or perks.\r\nFlexibility with Location\r\n\r\nStaying a bit outside the main tourist zone can lower costs, but factor in transport expenses.\r\nAdvance Booking Windows\r\n\r\nFor popular spring break spots (Cancún, Punta Cana), hostels can fill up quickly. Aim for 2–4 months in advance, especially if you’re traveling in a group and want to book multiple beds in the same dorm or a private room.\r\nBudget hotels also get busy around peak travel periods, so booking around 2–3 months out is wise.\r\nCheck Off-Season Rates\r\n\r\nIf you can shift your trip just before or after the peak spring break weeks, you might find more availability and cheaper rates.\r\n3. General Tips & Timing\r\nCombine Flight & Hotel\r\n\r\nPackage deals on travel sites (Expedia, Travelocity) can sometimes be cheaper than booking separately—though always compare the totals to find the best deal.\r\nTravel Midweek\r\n\r\nAccommodations might be cheaper on weekdays, and you’ll often have fewer crowds.\r\nShoulder Season Strategy\r\n\r\nIf your schedule allows, traveling slightly before/after the official “spring break” window can help you avoid premium prices.\r\nSet a Budget & Use Filters\r\n\r\nMany booking platforms let you set a nightly price range.

Safe travels! You said: What are some effective strategies or websites for finding discounted flights and affordable accommodations, such as hostels or budget-friendly hotels, in these destinations? Could you also suggest how far in advance we should book? Reasoned for a couple of seconds Here are some tried-and-true strategies and resources for finding discounted flights and budget-friendly accommodations, along with general guidelines on how far in advance you should book. 1. Discounted Flights Flight Search Websites Tools Aggregators Skyscanner: Popular for its cheapest month feature and flexible date searches. Momondo: Similar to Skyscanner, offers a wide range of airlines and alternative routes. Google Flights: Great for price tracking and calendar-based fare insights. Kayak: Offers price alerts and a flexible date calendar. Student-Focused StudentUniverse: Specifically caters to students and young travelers with negotiated airline deals. STA Travel: Although their retail presence has changed, keep an eye on any student or youth travel consolidators for special pricing. Deal-Specific Sites Newsletters Scotts Cheap Flights (now Going): Sends alerts for flash sales and mistake fares. Secret Flying or TravelPirates: Blogs and newsletters focusing on discounted, off-peak, or error fares. Flight Booking Tips Flexibility in Dates Airports If your spring break dates are a bit flexible, use the flexible date or cheapest month tools to spot significant savings. Check alternative airports (e.g., flying into Cozumel vs. Cancun, or considering Fort Lauderdale vs. Miami for a U.S. layover). Set Price Alerts Most flight aggregators let you set alerts for your preferred routes, notifying you of price drops. Off-Peak Travel Midweek flights (Tuesdays or Wednesdays) are often cheaper than weekend departures. Booking Windows Domestic Flights (e.g., to New Orleans): Aim to book 1–3 months in advance. International Flights (e.g., Mexico, Dominican Republic): Typically 2–4 months in advance for the best balance between availability and early-bird pricing. For busy spring break travel, consider the higher end of these ranges (or even slightly earlier if your dates are set). 2. Affordable Accommodations Booking Sites for Hostels Budget Hotels Hostelworld Specializes in hostels worldwide, showing reviews, ratings, and detailed amenities. Booking.com Offers filters for budget hotels and hostels, often with free cancellation. Look out for Genius discounts if you use Booking.com frequently. Agoda Strong presence in Asia but also has deals worldwide, sometimes listing prices in different currencies for better savings. Airbnb Private rooms or entire apartments can be surprisingly affordable when split among a group. Check cleaningservice fees, which can sometimes turn a cheap per-night rate into a bigger expense. HotelsCombined or Trivago Compare multiple hotel booking sites at once, helping you spot different rates for the same property. Accommodation Booking Tips Read Reviews Thoroughly Especially for hostels, focus on location, cleanliness, and security. Book Directly Sometimes contacting the hostelhotel directly can yield special discounts or perks. Flexibility with Location Staying a bit outside the main tourist zone can lower costs, but factor in transport expenses. Advance Booking Windows For popular spring break spots (Cancun, Punta Cana), hostels can fill up quickly. Aim for 2–4 months in advance, especially if youre traveling in a group and want to book multiple beds in the same dorm or a private room. Budget hotels also get busy around peak travel periods, so booking around 2–3 months out is wise. Check Off-Season Rates If you can shift your trip just before or after the peak spring break weeks, you might find more availability and cheaper rates. 3. General Tips Timing Combine Flight Hotel Package deals on travel sites (Expedia, Travelocity) can sometimes be cheaper than booking separatelythough always compare the totals to find the best deal. Travel Midweek Accommodations might be cheaper on weekdays, and youll often have fewer crowds. Shoulder Season Strategy If your schedule allows, traveling slightly beforeafter the official spring break window can help you avoid premium prices. Set a Budget Use Filters Many booking platforms let you set a nightly price range. This helps to avoid temptation and stick to your budget. Last-Minute Deals Occasionally, you might find last-minute bargains if rooms or flights are undersold, but this is risky around popular spring break destinations. More often than not, prices will spike closer to the date. Suggested Booking Timelines Flights: 2–4 Months in Advance for international. 1–3 Months in Advance for domestic. If youre traveling over a major holiday or peak spring break window, err on the early side (3–6 months if possible). Accommodations: 2–3 Months out for hostels and budget hotels in high-demand areas (Cancun, Punta Cana, etc.). Sometimes you can wait until 1–2 months for New Orleans, especially if its not during Mardi Grasbut for spring break or festival season, book earlier. By combining these strategiesflexible dates, price alerts, early booking, and thorough research on accommodationsyoull be better positioned to lock in great deals for your spring break trip.

Safe travels! What are some effective strategies or websites for finding discounted flights and affordable accommodations, such as hostels or budget-friendly hotels, in these destinations? Could you also suggest how far in advance we should book? Reasoned for a couple of seconds Here are some tried-and-true strategies and resources for finding discounted flights and budget-friendly accommodations, along with general guidelines on how far in advance you should book. 1. Discounted Flights Flight Search Websites Tools Aggregators Skyscanner: Popular for its cheapest month feature and flexible date searches. Momondo: Similar to Skyscanner, offers a wide range of airlines and alternative routes. Google Flights: Great for price tracking and calendar-based fare insights. Kayak: Offers price alerts and a flexible date calendar. Student-Focused StudentUniverse: Specifically caters to students and young travelers with negotiated airline deals. STA Travel: Although their retail presence has changed, keep an eye on any student or youth travel consolidators for special pricing. Deal-Specific Sites Newsletters Scotts Cheap Flights (now Going): Sends alerts for flash sales and mistake fares. Secret Flying or TravelPirates: Blogs and newsletters focusing on discounted, off-peak, or error fares. Flight Booking Tips Flexibility in Dates Airports If your spring break dates are a bit flexible, use the flexible date or cheapest month tools to spot significant savings. Check alternative airports (e.g., flying into Cozumel vs. Cancun, or considering Fort Lauderdale vs. Miami for a U.S. layover). Set Price Alerts Most flight aggregators let you set alerts for your preferred routes, notifying you of price drops. Off-Peak Travel Midweek flights (Tuesdays or Wednesdays) are often cheaper than weekend departures. Booking Windows Domestic Flights (e.g., to New Orleans): Aim to book 1–3 months in advance. International Flights (e.g., Mexico, Dominican Republic): Typically 2–4 months in advance for the best balance between availability and early-bird pricing. For busy spring break travel, consider the higher end of these ranges (or even slightly earlier if your dates are set). 2. Affordable Accommodations Booking Sites for Hostels Budget Hotels Hostelworld Specializes in hostels worldwide, showing reviews, ratings, and detailed amenities. Booking.com Offers filters for budget hotels and hostels, often with free cancellation. Look out for Genius discounts if you use Booking.com frequently. Agoda Strong presence in Asia but also has deals worldwide, sometimes listing prices in different currencies for better savings. Airbnb Private rooms or entire apartments can be surprisingly affordable when split among a group. Check cleaningservice fees, which can sometimes turn a cheap per-night rate into a bigger expense. HotelsCombined or Trivago Compare multiple hotel booking sites at once, helping you spot different rates for the same property. Accommodation Booking Tips Read Reviews Thoroughly Especially for hostels, focus on location, cleanliness, and security. Book Directly Sometimes contacting the hostelhotel directly can yield special discounts or perks. Flexibility with Location Staying a bit outside the main tourist zone can lower costs, but factor in transport expenses. Advance Booking Windows For popular spring break spots (Cancun, Punta Cana), hostels can fill up quickly. Aim for 2–4 months in advance, especially if youre traveling in a group and want to book multiple beds in the same dorm or a private room. Budget hotels also get busy around peak travel periods, so booking around 2–3 months out is wise. Check Off-Season Rates If you can shift your trip just before or after the peak spring break weeks, you might find more availability and cheaper rates. 3. General Tips Timing Combine Flight Hotel Package deals on travel sites (Expedia, Travelocity) can sometimes be cheaper than booking separatelythough always compare the totals to find the best deal. Travel Midweek Accommodations might be cheaper on weekdays, and youll often have fewer crowds. Shoulder Season Strategy If your schedule allows, traveling slightly beforeafter the official spring break window can help you avoid premium prices. Set a Budget Use Filters Many booking platforms let you set a nightly price range. This helps to avoid temptation and stick to your budget. Last-Minute Deals Occasionally, you might find last-minute bargains if rooms or flights are undersold, but this is risky around popular spring break destinations. More often than not, prices will spike closer to the date. Suggested Booking Timelines Flights: 2–4 Months in Advance for international. 1–3 Months in Advance for domestic. If youre traveling over a major holiday or peak spring break window, err on the early side (3–6 months if possible). Accommodations: 2–3 Months out for hostels and budget hotels in high-demand areas (Cancun, Punta Cana, etc.). Sometimes you can wait until 1–2 months for New Orleans, especially if its not during Mardi Grasbut for spring break or festival season, book earlier. By combining these strategiesflexible dates, price alerts, early booking, and thorough research on accommodationsyoull be better positioned to lock in great deals for your spring break trip.

Safe travels! What are some effective strategies or websites for finding discounted flights and affordable accommodations, such as hostels or budget-friendly hotels, in these destinations? Could you also suggest how far in advance we should book? Reasoned for a couple of seconds Here are some tried-and-true strategies and resources for finding discounted flights and budget-friendly accommodations, along with general guidelines on how far in advance you should book. 1. Discounted Flights Flight Search Websites Tools Aggregators Skyscanner: Popular for its cheapest month feature and flexible date searches. Momondo: Similar to Skyscanner, offers a wide range of airlines and alternative routes. Google Flights: Great for price tracking and calendar-based fare insights. Kayak: Offers price alerts and a flexible date calendar. Student-Focused StudentUniverse: Specifically caters to students and young travelers with negotiated airline deals. STA Travel: Although their retail presence has changed, keep an eye on any student or youth travel consolidators for special pricing. Deal-Specific Sites Newsletters Scotts Cheap Flights (now Going): Sends alerts for flash sales and mistake fares. Secret Flying or TravelPirates: Blogs and newsletters focusing on discounted, off-peak, or error fares. Flight Booking Tips Flexibility in Dates Airports If your spring break dates are a bit flexible, use the flexible date or cheapest month tools to spot significant savings. Check alternative airports (e.g., flying into Cozumel vs. Cancun, or considering Fort Lauderdale vs. Miami for a U.S. layover). Set Price Alerts Most flight aggregators let you set alerts for your preferred routes, notifying you of price drops. Off-Peak Travel Midweek flights (Tuesdays or Wednesdays) are often cheaper than weekend departures. Booking Windows Domestic Flights (e.g., to New Orleans): Aim to book 1–3 months in advance. International Flights (e.g., Mexico, Dominican Republic): Typically 2–4 months in advance for the best balance between availability and early-bird pricing. For busy spring break travel, consider the higher end of these ranges (or even slightly earlier if your dates are set). 2. Affordable Accommodations Booking Sites for Hostels Budget Hotels Hostelworld Specializes in hostels worldwide, showing reviews, ratings, and detailed amenities. Booking.com Offers filters for budget hotels and hostels, often with free cancellation. Look out for Genius discounts if you use Booking.com frequently. Agoda Strong presence in Asia but also has deals worldwide, sometimes listing prices in different currencies for better savings. Airbnb Private rooms or entire apartments can be surprisingly affordable when split among a group. Check cleaningservice fees, which can sometimes turn a cheap per-night rate into a bigger expense. HotelsCombined or Trivago Compare multiple hotel booking sites at once, helping you spot different rates for the same property. Accommodation Booking Tips Read Reviews Thoroughly Especially for hostels, focus on location, cleanliness, and security. Book Directly Sometimes contacting the hostelhotel directly can yield special discounts or perks. Flexibility with Location Staying a bit outside the main tourist zone can lower costs, but factor in transport expenses. Advance Booking Windows For popular spring break spots (Cancun, Punta Cana), hostels can fill up quickly. Aim for 2–4 months in advance, especially if youre traveling in a group and want to book multiple beds in the same dorm or a private room. Budget hotels also get busy around peak travel periods, so booking around 2–3 months out is wise. Check Off-Season Rates If you can shift your trip just before or after the peak spring break weeks, you might find more availability and cheaper rates. 3. General Tips Timing Combine Flight Hotel Package deals on travel sites (Expedia, Travelocity) can sometimes be cheaper than booking separatelythough always compare the totals to find the best deal. Travel Midweek Accommodations might be cheaper on weekdays, and youll often have fewer crowds. Shoulder Season Strategy If your schedule allows, traveling slightly beforeafter the official spring break window can help you avoid premium prices. Set a Budget Use Filters Many booking platforms let you set a nightly price range. This helps to avoid temptation and stick to your budget. Last-Minute Deals Occasionally, you might find last-minute bargains if rooms or flights are undersold, but this is risky around popular spring break destinations. More often than not, prices will spike closer to the date. Suggested Booking Timelines Flights: 2–4 Months in Advance for international. 1–3 Months in Advance for domestic. If youre traveling over a major holiday or peak spring break window, err on the early side (3–6 months if possible). Accommodations: 2–3 Months out for hostels and budget hotels in high-demand areas (Cancun, Punta Cana, etc.). Sometimes you can wait until 1–2 months for New Orleans, especially if its not during Mardi Grasbut for spring break or festival season, book earlier. By combining these strategiesflexible dates, price alerts, early booking, and thorough research on accommodationsyoull be better positioned to lock in great deals for your spring break trip.
